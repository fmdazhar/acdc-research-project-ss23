    "## Background and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The modules of vehicle guidance within the AD software stack are responsible for enabling a comfortable, efficient, and safe guidance of the vehicle. To this end, the guidance system relies on a model of the environment, derived by several perception-, V2X- and environment-interpretation modules (and potentially additional map-information).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important task is to guide the vehicle safely through its environment, e.g., avoiding collisions with other traffic participants in the local environment. Moreover, the vehicle is obliged to comply with traffic regulations, e.g., to stop at a red traffic light.\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular approach to trajectory planning is *Model Predictive Control (MPC)* including cost functions modeling different constraints. As an example, the ACDC MPC-planner employs the following cost term in order to stop at a *red* traffic light.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ j_{tl} = \\left( w_{tl} \\cdot \\left( \\cos \\left( \\frac{\\pi \\cdot {d_{tl}}^2}{{d_{ref,tl}}^2} \\right) + 1 \\right)\\right)^2 \\qquad \\textrm{if traffic light is red} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "with Euclidean distance $d_{tl}$ to the traffic light, reference distance $d_{ref,tl}$, and cost factor $w_{tl}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation has several drawbacks:\n",
    "- no consideration of the stop line geometry, instead the traffic light is treated as a point in space;\n",
    "- no difference in behavior in front of vs. behind the traffic light reference position;\n",
    "- no incorporation of future traffic light state changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible effect of this cost term, if analyzed on its own, could be the vehicle going around the traffic light without consideration of the stop line, since only the Euclidean distance to a reference point is considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you can observe a traffic light-aware planned trajectory in green, along with the traffic light status change information *(see [ACDC Exercise: SPaT Processing](https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/acdc/wiki/Section-5-SPaT-Processing))*.\n",

    "   1. define performance metrics to evaluate your cost function improvements (e.g., stop distance to traffic light);\n",
    "   2. perform simulations using your implementation and gather data as rosbags;\n",
    "   3. evaluate and discuss the results (e.g., by analyzing the rosbag data in Python using the [rosbag API](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/reading%20msgs%20from%20a%20bag%20file)).\n",
