    "## Background and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The modules of vehicle guidance within the AD software stack are responsible for enabling a comfortable, efficient, and safe guidance of the vehicle. To this end, the guidance system relies on a model of the environment, derived by several perception-, V2X- and environment-interpretation modules (and potentially additional map-information).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important task is to guide the vehicle safely through its environment, e.g., avoiding collisions with other traffic participants in the local environment. Moreover, the vehicle is obliged to comply with traffic regulations, e.g., to stop at a red traffic light.\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular approach to trajectory planning is *Model Predictive Control (MPC)* including cost functions modeling different constraints. As an example, the ACDC MPC-planner employs the following cost term in order to keep distance to the vehicle ahead:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ j_{dyn} = \\left( w_{dyn} \\cdot \\left( \\cos \\left( \\frac{\\pi \\cdot {d_{obj}}^2}{{d_{ref,obj}}^2} \\right) + 1 \\right)\\right)^2 \\qquad \\textrm{if} \\quad d_{obj} < d_{ref} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "with Euclidean distance $d_{obj}$ to the other object, reference distance $d_{ref,obj}$, and cost factor $w_{dyn}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation has several drawbacks:\n",
    "- only the current position of the dynamic object is considered, although the dynamic object has probably moved away already once the ego vehicle reaches its current position\n",
    "- no geometries of ego vehicle or other object are considered\n",
    "- only one single other object is considered (usually the leading vehicle as the most relevant target)\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you can observe the effects of this implementation: the planned trajectory (green) only reaches up right before the current position of the other dynamic object.\n",

    "   1. define performance metrics to evaluate your cost function improvements (e.g., TTC);\n",
    "   2. perform simulations using your implementation and gather data as rosbags;\n",
    "   3. evaluate and discuss the results (e.g., by analyzing the rosbag data in Python using the [rosbag API](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/reading%20msgs%20from%20a%20bag%20file)).\n",
