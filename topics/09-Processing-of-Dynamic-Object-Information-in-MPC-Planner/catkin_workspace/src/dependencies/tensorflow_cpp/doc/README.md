# tensorflow_cpp

*tensorflow_cpp* is a header-only library that provides helpful wrappers around the [TensorFlow C++ API](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc), allowing you to **easily load, inspect, and run saved models and frozen graphs in C++**. The library is easy to integrate into CMake projects, but is also available as a [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) package.

Please note that this is the Code API Documentation. Check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/tensorflow_cpp) for more information on how to install and use this library.
