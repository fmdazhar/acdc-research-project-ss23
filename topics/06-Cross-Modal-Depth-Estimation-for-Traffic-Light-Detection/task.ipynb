    "## Background and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "An accurate knowledge about traffic light states is vital for fully-automated driving in urban environments. If traffic lights were equipped with the right hard- and software, V2X communication would be a reasonable way of transmitting traffic light states to automated vehicles nearby. As a fallback to V2X solutions or in situations, where V2X is not supported, it is also desirable to have a perception function dedicated to detecting traffic lights and their current state from camera images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual problem is two-fold: first, traffic lights need to be detected in camera images and their current state needs to be inferred; second, the algorithm needs to evaluate whether the detected traffic light has any influence on the currently planned trajectory or whether it can be ignored. This topic is supposed to partially deal with the second task, namely the estimation of the traffic light's position in 3D space. If the position was known, it could then be matched to a particular traffic light on an HD map in order evaluate whether the traffic light is important to the automated vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exact depth estimation from a single monocular camera image is not possible in closed-form due to ambiguities (e.g., there is no way to differentiate between a small object closer to the camera vs. a larger scaled version of the same object, which is further away). One way to obtain depth information is to use a stereoscopic camera pair. Another option is to make use of other sensors that, opposed to standard cameras, deliver three-dimensional information. In particular, this topic deals with the combination of camera and lidar point cloud data, in order to estimate the 3D position of a traffic light detected in the camera image."
